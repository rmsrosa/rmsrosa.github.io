<div class="franklin-content"><h1 id="greetings"><a href="#greetings">Greetings</a></h1>
<p>This is an introductory post. I used to have a blog about homebrewing, initiated in 2006, in a time where not much information was available, so I guess mine turned out to be of some value. Since then, I was happy to see the homebrewing community grow so large in Brazil.</p>
<p>This time, I want to revive the blog, but open up the focus, including math and coding. And it is for this reason that I decided, reluctantly, to write some posts in English, including this one.</p>
<p>For a long time, my personal homepages were all in pure html, sometimes with a little javascript. About two years ago, I revamped it in Python/Flask. Last year, though, I realized the power of <a href="https://julialang.org">the Julia language</a> and decided now to rewrite my website in Julia/Franklin.</p>
<p><a href="https://franklinjl.org">Franklin</a> is a static-site generator written purely in Julia. It is so much easier than Flask and good enough for me since I didn&#39;t really need the power of Flask as a dynamic site. In fact, I would build a static site out of it before publishing it.</p>
<p>With Franklin, the only thing that was bothering me was that I wouldn&#39;t be able to have comments on the blogs, since it is a static site. However, I ended up learning that there are a number of tools and apps to embed a comment section in static sites with  javascripts or iframe. With that, Franklin is just perfect for what I need.</p>
<p>Deploying the site is as simple as pushing the changes to a github repo. For the comments, there are paid and free apps, open and closed source. I chose to use <a href="https://utteranc.es">utterances</a>, a free, open-source no-fuss solution that keeps all the comments in another github repo &#40;one can use the same as that for the website, but I chose to use a different one, for more independence&#41; and is pretty easy to install.</p>
<p>Anyways, that is it for the Introduction.</p>
<p>Cheers&#33;</p>
