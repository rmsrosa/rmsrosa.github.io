# My personal website

This repository contains my personal website, rendered automatically by Github in [rmsrosa.github.io](https://rmsrosa.github.io).

It is built with [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), in the [Julia language](https://julialang.org).

The build used to be done in the repo [rmsrosa/WebsiteGen](https://github.com/rmsrosa/WebsiteGen), and the generated page was kept in sync with this repo, but now I am trying to do it automatically from here.

The blog comments are handled by [uterances](https://utteranc.es) and stored in the repo [github.com/rmsrosa/blog_comments](https://github.com/rmsrosa/blog_comments).
